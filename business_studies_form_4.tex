%\chapter*{Dedication}
%To my students at Kamuzu Barracks CDSS.

%\chapter*{Preface}
%This book provides clear and easy-to-understand notes for Business Studies.
%The motivation for writing it arose from the observation that many of my students
%do not have access to quality Business Studies materials, and that most existing
%books often contain content that is even challenging for undergraduate students.
%To make high school Business Studies more accessible and understandable,
%I created this book.

\chapter{Trade}
\section{Roles of Government in Promoting Trade}
Governments play an important role in promoting trade through various ways and for different reasons.
These roles can be discussed in two contexts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Local Government}
	\item \textbf{Central Government}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Local Government}
The local government operates at a smaller, regional level within a country.
It governs cities, towns, districts, or villages.
Examples of local governments include \textit{District Councils}, \textit{Town Assemblies}, and \textit{Village Committees}.

\subsection{Roles of Local Government in Promoting Trade}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Providing public utilities such as local roads, markets, and bridges that facilitate trade.
	\item Ensuring security within their areas of jurisdiction.
	\item Issuing business licenses and permits.
	\item Supplying investment information to local entrepreneurs.
	\item Offering training and information facilities to traders.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Central Government}
The central government is the political authority that governs the entire nation.
It is the highest level of government in a country, with power and authority over all regions.

\subsection{Roles of the Central Government in Promoting Trade}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Establishing ministries and departments that promote both domestic and foreign trade.
	\item Constructing and improving national infrastructure such as highways, railways, telecommunication systems, schools, hospitals, and energy sources.
	\item Licensing and regulating businesses at the national level.
	\item Providing financial assistance and incentives to traders and investors.
	\item Protecting local businesses from unfair international competition.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Trade Liberalisation}
Trade liberalisation refers to the process of reducing or removing trade barriers such as tariffs, import quotas, and restrictions,
in order to allow goods and services to move more freely across borders.
Its aim is to encourage open competition and wider markets.

\subsection{Advantages of Trade Liberalisation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Promotes competition, which improves efficiency and quality of goods and services.
	\item Encourages foreign investment and inflow of capital.
	\item Provides consumers with a wider variety of goods at lower prices.
	\item Enhances international cooperation and relations among countries.
	\item Allows countries to specialize in the production of goods where they have a comparative advantage.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Disadvantages of Trade Liberalisation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Local industries may collapse due to competition from stronger foreign companies.
	\item Can lead to over-dependence on foreign products.
	\item May result in loss of government revenue from reduced tariffs and import duties.
	\item Risk of exploitation of developing countries by developed nations.
	\item Can increase unemployment if local firms shut down due to competition.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Economic Integration}
Economic integration refers to the process in which countries come together to form groups or unions,
with the aim of promoting trade, investment, and cooperation by reducing or eliminating barriers among themselves.

\subsection{Forms of Economic Integration}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Free Trade Area} – Countries remove tariffs and quotas on trade among themselves but maintain their own trade policies with non-members.
	\item \textbf{Customs Union} – Member countries adopt a common external tariff on goods from non-member countries.
	\item \textbf{Common Market} – In addition to a customs union, member states allow free movement of labor, capital, and services.
	\item \textbf{Economic Union} – Countries integrate their economies further by harmonizing fiscal and monetary policies.
	\item \textbf{Political Union} – The highest level of integration where countries merge certain political structures alongside economic cooperation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Trade Protocols}
Trade protocols are formal agreements between countries or groups of countries
that set out the rules, procedures, and conditions for conducting trade.
They are designed to simplify, harmonize, and promote fair trading practices.

\subsection{Outline of Trade Protocols}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{SADC Trade Protocol} – Promotes free trade among Southern African Development Community member states.
	\item \textbf{COMESA Trade Protocol} – Aims at creating a larger market through free trade among Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa member states.
	\item \textbf{AfCFTA (African Continental Free Trade Area)} – Promotes intra-African trade by reducing tariffs and barriers across the continent.
	\item \textbf{WTO Agreements} – Provide guidelines for international trade practices among member countries of the World Trade Organization.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Globalisation}
Globalisation refers to the process by which countries of the world become more interconnected and interdependent
through trade, investment, communication, technology, and cultural exchange.

\subsection{Advantages of Globalisation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Expands markets for goods and services across borders.
	\item Facilitates transfer of technology and innovation.
	\item Encourages foreign investment and employment opportunities.
	\item Promotes cultural exchange and international understanding.
	\item Improves access to a wide variety of goods and services globally.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Disadvantages of Globalisation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Can erode local cultures and traditions due to foreign influences.
	\item Increases competition, leading to closure of local industries.
	\item May widen the gap between developed and developing countries.
	\item Can lead to economic dependence on foreign countries.
	\item Increases vulnerability to global economic crises.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Institutions that Promote Trade in Malawi}
Several institutions in Malawi have been established to promote and regulate trade,
ensuring that both local and international business activities run smoothly.
Examples include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCCI).
	\item Malawi Investment and Trade Centre (MITC).
	\item Ministry of Trade and Industry.
	\item Reserve Bank of Malawi.
	\item Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Roles of Institutions that Promote Trade in Malawi}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{MCCCI} – Represents the interests of the private sector and provides a platform for networking and trade promotion.
	\item \textbf{MITC} – Promotes investment and export trade opportunities for Malawi.
	\item \textbf{Ministry of Trade and Industry} – Formulates trade policies, regulations, and oversees implementation.
	\item \textbf{Reserve Bank of Malawi} – Regulates foreign exchange and ensures a stable financial environment for trade.
	\item \textbf{MRA} – Collects customs duties, enforces tariffs, and prevents smuggling to protect local industries.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Summary / Revision Points}

	\item Central government manages nationwide policies, infrastructure, and protection of industries.
	\item \textbf{Trade liberalisation} reduces barriers and promotes open competition.
	\item It has advantages (variety, lower prices, efficiency) and disadvantages (collapse of local industries, loss of revenue).
	\item \textbf{Economic integration} takes forms: Free Trade Area, Customs Union, Common Market, Economic Union, and Political Union.
	\item \textbf{Trade protocols} (SADC, COMESA, AfCFTA, WTO) set rules for regional and global trade.
	\item \textbf{Globalisation} connects the world but has both opportunities and challenges.
	\item In Malawi, key trade institutions include MCCCI, MITC, Ministry of Trade and Industry, RBM, and MRA.
